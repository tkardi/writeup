Hi there, I'm Tõnis Kärdi. I occupy myself as a _freelance-GIS-person_ using
the name LonLat OÜ. Most often you'll find me offering my services under the
auspices of [UEC OÜ](http://uec.ee/) to bring you spatial awareness in IT
consultancy.

This is the place I will be trying to do some writing up on the things that
I've been up to with (mainly) FOSS4G software. Mostly for
keeping track for myself, but hopefully it will be of some use for you, dear
visitor from the interwebs aswell.

You're very welcome to email your comments or questions on
any of the posts to [tonis.kardi@gmail.com](mailto:tonis.kardi@gmail.com).
Otherwise I'm found under the handle @tkardi.
