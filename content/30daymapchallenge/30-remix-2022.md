description: "#30DayMapChallenge: A flat earth 1-degree graticule in Web Mercator with a little rotation (who knows how much but does it really matter? :)) to scale the map up and show the Mercator distortions a little better together with parallel artifacts."
---
I was really planning to rework [2022 / Day 19: Globe](../19-globe-2022) to
x-axis meters in logarithmic scale but it looked really boring. So instead
today I'm going to do a 1-degree graticule (re:
[2022 / Day 13: A five minute map](../13-fiveminutes-2022/)) for a flat earth map
(re: [2022 / Day 20: Favourite](../20-favourite-2022)).

The SQL itself is much simpler because it essentially only needs to draw a set
of concentric rings around the Null Island spanning out 180 degrees with a 1
degree step (as _parallels_). This can be done straight on the location, not
needing to [st_translate](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Translate.html) everything
from the pole (because there's no need to measure any real distances). Meaning
an incremental [st_buffer](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Buffer.html) coupled
with [st_boundary](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Boundary.html) will suffice. This
is done in the CTE `paral`.

For the meridian lines from the Null Island the CTE called `merid` constructs
a line from the origin to every point measured 1 degree apart along a circle
that covers the whole World - essentially a
doing a [st_lineinterpolatepoint](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_LineInterpolatePoint.html)
every 1/360 fraction along the
[st_boundary](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Boundary.html) of a
[st_buffer](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Buffer.html) set at 180 degrees from
the point of origin `st_point(0,0,4326)::geometry`. It's important to do this
using the `geometry` type, not `geography` because otherwise the Earth would be
assumed to be round. Also, as the first node a buffer will be at 90 degrees
clockwise from north, the query includes a
[st_rotate](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Rotate.html)
for `radians(90)` so the first point will be at
[st_azimuth](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Azimuth.html) 0.

The transformation from [epsg:4326](https://epsg.io/4326) to
[epsg:3857](https://epsg.io/3857) is done using QGIS. Because PostGIS will
complain with a `transform: tolerance condition error (-20)`. QGIS will survive
with linestrings going out of the [epsg:3857](https://epsg.io/3857) bounds (
too far North/South) it seems as long as the first and last point of the linestring
are within the bounds. That's the reason why the `merid` lines are chopped to
the _correct length_ with doing a
[st_intersection](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Intersection.html) with the World's
bounds from the CTE `bounds`.
