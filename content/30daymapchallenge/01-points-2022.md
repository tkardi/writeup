description: "#30DayMapChallenge: Looking at PostGIS spatial clustering functions on a set of random points."
---

The idea of this SQL is to check out / portray three different spatial clustering
functions that come with PostGIS and see how they work compared to each other.
We'll be looking at:

- [`st_clusterwithin`](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_ClusterWithin.html)
- [`st_clusterdbscan`](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_ClusterDBSCAN.html)
- [`st_clusterkmeans`](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_ClusterKMeans.html)

Although they do pretty much the same thing there are still some differences:

- [`st_clusterwithin`](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_ClusterWithin.html) is an
aggregate function, takes a set of geometries and a desired distance parameter,
and returns a set of GeometryCollections, one row for each discovered _cluster_.
- [`st_clusterdbscan`](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_ClusterDBSCAN.html) is a
window-function (is this the correct term?), takes a set of geometries, a
desired distance parameter, and the minimum number of geometries that should
make up a cluster. Returns an integer which identifies the _cluster_,
one for each input row.
- [`st_clusterkmeans`](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_ClusterKMeans.html) is similar
to [`st_clusterdbscan`](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_ClusterDBSCAN.html) only
that it requires the number of desired clusters as input not min distance
between them.

In order to make the results comparable the following SQL uses the same set of
random points generated within a specific bounding box, clusters these points
with a fixed set of parameters: 1,10000,20000,30000,40000,50000 m for
[`st_clusterwithin`](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_ClusterWithin.html) and
[`st_clusterdbscan`](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_ClusterDBSCAN.html), and
then bases the number of different clusters for
[`st_clusterkmeans`](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_ClusterKMeans.html) on the
output of [`st_clusterdbscan`](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_ClusterDBSCAN.html).

One interesting thing to note is that
[`st_clusterwithin`](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_ClusterWithin.html) and
[`st_clusterdbscan`](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_ClusterDBSCAN.html) both give
very similar results while results for
[`st_clusterkmeans`](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_ClusterKMeans.html)
look spatially more coherent (especially in the low end of cluster numbers).
