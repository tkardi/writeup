### Data
- [Estonian address objects and addresses](https://geoportaal.maaamet.ee/eng/Spatial-Data/Address-Data-p313.html)
- [Lithuanian address data](https://www.registrucentras.lt/p/1186)

### Tools
OGR, PostGIS, QGIS, Inkscape.

### Summary
The idea of this map is to portray addresspoint Open Data in the Baltic
states. Estonian address data was made available for free download and open
usage by the Estonian [Land Board](https://maaamet.ee) already a
long time (~10 years or so?) ago. The Lithuanian [Registr≈≥
centras](https://www.registrucentras.lt/) decided to do the same in October 2020.
Hopefully the Latvian addresses will be available aswell soon.

To throw in a little bit of colorfulness the addresspoints are colored by
their postal code value.
