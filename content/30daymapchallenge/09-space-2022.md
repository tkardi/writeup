description: "#30DayMapChallenge: Dividing empty space between polygons."
---
I wrote a little something about this same subject
[a few years ago](/writeup/post/2018/07/21/subdividing-space/) in the context
of expanding admin unit polygon boundaries out to the sea using coastline
vertices. And for a nice homogeneous dataset it works really nicely. Now
if you apply the same thing in a different kind of situation (e.g. filling
in holes between cadastral parcels of varying sizes **and most importantly**
with varying amounts of vertices on the sides facing but not quite touching
each other) it might not be the most suitable solution.

![Problems with dividing "empty space" between polygons: the saw-teeth. Original
polygons in darker and their corresponding "conquered" space in
lighter color](../img/space-div-probs.png)

In todays challenge I will try to tackle the problem of _saw-teeth_ that arises
from... too little points. But that said, adding more vertices to polygon
boundary will only make the _saw-teeth_ finer in resolution and will not deal
with the problem.

Todays output image will be an animated gif showing the different stages
(CTE results) that the query produces. The query itself (see below) is still a
_oneliner_.

The query itself starts off again with defining the `minmax` corners, and
constructing a bounding geometry into `bounds` using
[st_envelope](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Envelope.html). Then generating a
bunch of random points ([st_generatepoints](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_GeneratePoints.html))
and clustering them with [st_clusterkmeans](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_ClusterKMeans.html)
into `clusters`. Now in order to get concave polygons instead of convex ones
[st_concavehull](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_ConcaveHull.html) is used with
`0.0` produce a hull of maximum concaveness as `areas`. For extra fun.

So far so good. Until now we've produced only the testing dataset. This is
where we start the real processing.

![The testing dataset we'll use for dividing space. Lets go!](../img/space-01-areas.png)

First off, extract all area boundary vertices with
[st_dumppoints](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_DumpPoints.html),
and keeping in mind that the boundary linestring extracted with
[st_boundary](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Boundary.html) will have
first and last points in the same location so
filter last one out using the _number of vertices per geometry_ calculated by
[st_numpoints](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_NumPoints.html).
All of this is in the CTE called `pts`.

![Extracted vertices](../img/space-02-pts.png)

Secondly, we'll also extract all segments of `area` boundaries with
[st_dumpsegments](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_DumpSegments.html) into `segs`.
For some of them we'll add extra vertices: for every point in `pts` find the
closest _other_ segment ([st_dwithin](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_DWithin.html)
and **must not** belong to the same `area`), locate the closest
point along the segment with
[st_linelocatepoint](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_LineLocatePoint.html) (
which returns a fraction between 0 and 1) and then
[st_lineinterpolatepoint](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_LineInterpolatePoint.html)
to get the geometry of the extra point **for the other area** (the one,
whose segment this is) which would balance out the effect of `area A`.`node X`
having too much influence on the neighboring area with no vertices in sight
nearby. Out of all of these possible `extra_pts` it makes sense to use only
the ones where a linestring constructed (
[st_makeline](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_MakeLine.html)) from a node on the
boundary of `area A` to an interpolated closest point location on the boundary
of `area B` does not [st_crosses](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Crosses.html)
the boundary of `area A`.

![Extra points for neighboring areas closest segment. The lines in grey portray
the connector line between a boundary node of one area and the closest point
on the other area. This is the line that should not cross the formers boundary.
](../img/space-03-extra-pnts.png)

Then [st_collect](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Collect.html) the points
(both `pts` and `extra_pts`) and then generate
[st_voronoipolygons](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_VoronoiPolygons.html) followed
by a [st_dump](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Dump.html) to single part polygons
and discovering which area identifier (`cluster_id` in this case) the voronoi
cell belongs to by joining `pts` and `extra_pts` with
[st_within](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Within.html).

![Voronoi cells with assigned area identifiers](../img/space-04-voronoi.png)

Just to be on the safe side, lets do a
[st_snaptogrid](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_SnapToGrid.html) followed by
[st_makevalid](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_MakeValid.html)
and [st_dump](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Dump.html) again so we can filter out
only `POLYGON` type geometries in the last step.

The last step consists of aggregating all voronoi cells with the same
`cluster_id` value using [st_union](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Union.html) and
then finding their intersection with the original `bounds` geometry
with [st_intersection](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Intersection.html).

![...and done](../img/space-05-voro-union.png)

The result is still not perfect but i think the direction this is going is
producing way better results than previously. One thing to be thought about
and maybe elaborated a bit more is how to create the `extra_pts` on neighboring
areas boundaries. Currently only the closest one is picked. But as it shows up
this might be inadequate in a situation where multiple area corners are close
by. As the saying goes: more research needs to be done. :)
