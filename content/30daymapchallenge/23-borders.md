### Summary
An idea for this map was born some years prior when the alchohol tax was
raised and the border shopping frenzy began. Envisioned with
a friend in the sauna, fuelled by a few (non-border) beers and talking about it
as an interactive map where you input your address, the amount of your car's
fuel consumption, and the kind of alchohol you'd be interested in with the
backend fetching fuel prices and alcohol prices and then telling you how many
units you'd need to buy for this trip to be economically feasible.
