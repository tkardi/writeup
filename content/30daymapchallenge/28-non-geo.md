### Data
- [addresses from the Estonian Land Board](https://geoportaal.maaamet.ee/eng/Spatial-Data/Address-Data-p313.html)

### Tools
PostGIS, QGIS

### Summary
Mapping all streets of Tartu and residential houses (dots) and their numbers
(labels) associated with those streets. The house number labeling is not good
but if you look closely you can see that the numbers are rotated to be
_feet-towards-the-streetline_. Which in retrospect most probably shows my
mind being stuck too much in geography - in this case sidedness of a
street line (literally) has no meaning whatsoever.
