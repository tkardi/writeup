description: "#30DayMapChallenge: Calculateing shared paths between polygons and their L/R sidekicks using PostGIS"
---
Today I'll be looking at calculating shared paths of polygons with deriving
left/right side information for them. This is useful for example for
generating lines from admin area polygons where every border line is
present only once. Or for example simplifying polygons without losing
topological integrity.

I wrote about this same subject
[some time ago](/writeup/post/2018/05/21/calculating-a-polygon-mesh/) but
using a different approach to do it. Time has passed and i've developed
(hopefully) my skills and understanding, so I'm ready to try out
[st_sharedpaths](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_SharedPaths.html).

My original approach had more aggregation in it so so hopefully this way it
will be more performant. As a test dataset I'll generate a set of random points
with [st_generatepoints](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_GeneratePoints.html)
as in many previous times during this years #30DayMapChallenge, and cluster them
using [st_clusterkmeans](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_ClusterKMeans.html),
followed by doing a
[st_voronoipolygons](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_VoronoiPolygons.html)
to create a space evenly filled in with polygons (see `CTE` called voros).

![Voronoi polygons we'll be calculating shared paths for. These are
calculated from random point clusters therefore they will not look exactly the
same with every query](../img/d18-2022/voronoi-polygons.png)

As noted before - my original approach to solving this was to aggregate all
polygon boundaries and then [st_linemerge](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_LineMerge.html)
them. Which can become a rather tedious task if there's a lot of data.
A better way around is with [st_sharedpaths](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_SharedPaths.html)
which works with a pair of geometries and returns a `GeometryCollection`
of two elements:

- the first one is lines going in the same direction,
- the second is lines going in the opposite directions

In order to rule out duplicates I'll condense the pairing geometries into
and array ordered by the value of their respective identifiers (`cl` in
this case) which allows me to do a

```
select
    distinct on (<ordered_identifier_array>)
    <ordered_identifier_array>, <ordered_geoms_array>
from
    ...
```

Another way for getting unique combinations here would be to use

```
select
    *
from (
    select
        row_number() over(partition by <ordered_identifier_array>) as rn
        <ordered_identifier_array>, <ordered_geoms_array>
    from
        ...
) x
where
    x.rn = 1
```
as I used for [2022 / Day 6: Network](../06-network-2022/). The result of
this is encapsulated in CTE `pairs`.

For attaching L/R side info to the linestring I previously used an approach of
doing a minuscule L/R [st_offsetcurve](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_OffsetCurve.html)
followed by [st_lineinterpolatepoint](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_LineInterpolatePoint.html)
to the midway of the offset linestring and then
[st_within](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Within.html) with the midway point
to discover what's on either side of the line. Now with
[st_sharedpaths](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_SharedPaths.html) it's a bit
simpler because:

- out of the pair of geometries we know which one is first and which one second
- [st_sharedpaths](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_SharedPaths.html) returns
linestrings **in the direction of the first geometry**.

So unless the polygon interiors share space / overlap (meaning their shared paths of
boundaries are moving in the same direction) we can safely assume that
the first of the geometry pair is always to the right, and the second one to
the left for clockwise ([st_ispolygoncw](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_IsPolygonCW.html))
and the other way around for counter-clockwise
([st_ispolygonccw](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_IsPolygonCCW.html)) polygons.
Which is also the reason why
[st_forcepolygoncw](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_ForcePolygonCW.html) is used after
the voronoi cell unioning in CTE `voros`. Although it doesn't do anything in
this case - our polygons will be clockwise by default.
