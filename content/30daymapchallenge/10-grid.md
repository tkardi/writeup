### Data
[Estonian Motor Insurance Bureau and the Estonian Insurance Association](https://www.lkf.ee/en/statistics)
[Estonian Land Board Topographic Database roads layer](https://geoportaal.maaamet.ee/eng/Spatial-Data/Estonian-Topographic-Database-p305.html)

### Tools
PostGIS, QGIS.

### Summary
Reusing a 1km hex grid I had created previously in PostGIS for I can't remember
what reason and simply learning some moving window statistics calculations
which I had not really done before. So we have Insurance claims per road
km in a hex cell.
