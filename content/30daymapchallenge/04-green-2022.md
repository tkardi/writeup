description: "#30DayMapChallenge: The randomness of random points in PostGIS"
---

Lets have a look at the randomness of points. For this i'll create 256
random points in my bounding box using
[st_generatepoints](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_GeneratePoints.html). A variant
of this function also accepts an int `seed` parameter which can be used to
regenerate a deterministic sequence of points.

I'll use the order of generated points to create a linestring
with [st_makeline](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_MakeLine.html) so that every
point will be joined with the next one using one of the [PostgreSQL
window functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-window.html)
called `lead`. And I'll end up with 255 linestrings - one for each
shade of green in the RGB model.

The ordering of the output with
```
order by oid desc
```
will make sure that bigger oid values (and hence brighter greens) will be
drawn first and lower oids (darker greens) later on.

Exported a few of these from QGIS as pngs and converted them into a gif.
