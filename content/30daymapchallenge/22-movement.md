### Data
- [OSRM routing based on OpenStreetMap contributors](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
- [GTFS data from the Estonian Road Administration](https://www.mnt.ee/eng/public-transportation/public-transport-information-system)

### Tools
Python, OSRM, PostGIS, QGIS

### Summary
Challenged by a friend/colleague who lives in PÃµlva to show that it's not
reasonably possible to reach Tallinn by train by 9:00 AM. And it was not. The
task essentially consisted of generating 30 minute drive-time areas for
train stations that actually had a morning connection that would reach
Tallinn (Balti Jaam) by 9:00 AM.
