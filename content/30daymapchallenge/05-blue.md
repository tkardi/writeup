### Summary
Taking a break from the weather forecast data.

So blue... the first thing to pop into my mind was water. But simply water seemed
to be a bit boring so adding a twist to it why not do a map of the world in
the Estonian national coordinate reference system, L-EST'97
([epsg:3301](http://epsg.io/3301))?

Well here you go
