---
If I remember correctly then [Vitalogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalogy)
was my first ever official-official recording that I bought - a cassette
recording and I think it cost a whopping 60 EEK (abt 3-4 EUR). I remember it
was the summertime so it must have been 1995. At the time I
did not have a CD player and CDs were almost 4-5 times the price - you simply
could not afford them anyway. Vinyls could be found in only a few specialized
shops mostly selling drum and bass and other electro music. And those were even
more expensive. So in a way it is no wonder that still around those times as
it had been for decades before aswell (and as I later learned, in the
"western world" it was called) _bootlegging_ was *the* way to get or hear new
music - sharing yours and record tapes at your friends place (which by all means
was essentially a copyright infringement, but times were different and nobody
cared, or really understood what that meant). But anyway, that's not what I
wanted to talk about. Today's entry for the challenge is a _hommage_ to the
band I guess "shaped my later teenage-years".

So without any further ado:

**SPIN THE BLACK CIRCLE!**

We begin by constructing the `letters` section of the vinyl label with
[st_letters](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Letters.html) composing them as
two separate lines (of text) and shifting them away from each other
with [st_translate](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Translate.html) so the
center of the disk (for the pin-hole) would be between them.

`letter_bounds` builds the vinyl label area using a combination of
[st_buffer](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Buffer.html)
and [st_minimumboundingradius](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_MinimumBoundingRadius.html).

For song tracklines in `tracks` we're creating a spiral set in the center of our
would be vinyl disk pin-hole. The solution is derived from a
[GIS StackExchange answer](https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/415996) by
Martin Davies (the original author of JTS, if I'm not mistaken). Except for
some variable numbers that I changed there to make it suitable for this
use-case the only real change was to switch the spiral around to go
counter-clockwise (because the vinyl itself is moving clock-wise). And also
let's add a bit of `random()` to every point so we'll get the wobbling lines
as if on a real vinyl :)

Between every `track` there is a moment of `silence` which are simply
[st_buffer](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Buffer.html)s of the pin-hole center
set at every 25% of the whole disk width and then
[st_boundary](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Boundary.html) to convert them to
lines.

And finally we pull everything together for animating it with
[QGIS temporal controller](https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/3/animating_time_series.html)
using a `generate_series` to do a 360 degree turn of the vinyl.
