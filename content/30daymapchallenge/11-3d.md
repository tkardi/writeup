### Summary
3d? Ok, I've never really looked into it, but in order to get this done with
swiftly and without a really huge learning curve, I decided to interpret the
theme very broadly and did a map of 3 [_estlandssvenskar_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_Swedes)
villages on the Estonian western coast whose names - by coincidence - start with
the letter D. So here we are: the Villages of Dirsl√§tt, Diby, and Derhamn.
With colors in the swedish flag motifs.
