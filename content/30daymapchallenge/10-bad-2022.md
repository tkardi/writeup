description: "#30DayMapChallenge: Calculating a very linear color gradient from #BAD to #A55"
---
My knowledge of colors and colorspaces is really minimal (if not to say
_missing completely_) so very often you'll find me using very high-contrast
colors to differentiate stuff that has been queried from other stuff that had
been queried before. Anyway. Color gradients are not "linear", but this time
around - who cares!

So the query today will `generate_series` of color hex values between `#BAD`
and `#A55` by a step of `#001` in integers and convert those to hex again to
apply them on a set of concentric point buffers (increasing in size). In order
to make it more _spaced out, man!!!_ every disk will have a `01` opacity set
to it so we'll end up with hex code of

```
#RRGGBBAA
```
which can be very easily used in QGIS for styling every specific feature.
