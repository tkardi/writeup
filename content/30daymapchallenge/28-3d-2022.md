description: "#30DayMapChallenge: Unfolding a 3D geometry as a technical drawing using PostGIS."
---
I cant remember exactly which years in school this was (8th or 9th grade,
meaning abt 13-14-15 y.o. I was?) but we used to have technical drawing classes.
Mainly I did pretty good at it (if it wasn't for those pesky pencils
smothering all over the place), but I guess I had an edge too - both of my
parents were doing technical drawings of houses (essentially go out, take
measurements, and then later draw the whole thing up in 1:100 scale) so I had
had a chance to practice hand before. And this was before the advent of PCs so
this was all done by hand - first a draft with pencil on paper and then
afterwards a clean one on tracing paper with ink.

I really don't recall the process or the _supposed_ buildup (view placement
on paper) of the bolts and nuts or whatnot we drew in school, but I remember
the sheet was divided into four parts with a `view from top` (x-y coordinate
space), `view from side "A"` (in x-z coordinate space), and `view from side "B"`
(in y-z coordinate space).

Today's challenge, as a process is essentially very similar to what I was doing
about two years ago when _lofting_ the new boat - with the only difference:
the boat was done on paper (on three sheets of stitched together paper, to be
exact). And all the curves needed to be _lofted_ with the help a straight long
batten, a hammer, some nails to the floor, and pen. While in this case PostGIS
takes the heat off from transferring all points with exact measurements to
the other views. If you're interested in my _lofting_ experiences then you can
read about it a bit longer [here](/writeup/boat/lofting-grid/).

But for the SQL: it will first create a 3D _cone-like-half-cylinder_ from a
[st_boundary](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Boundary.html) boundary of a
[st_buffer](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Buffer.html)ed point
(see CTEs `pts` and `rings`). [st_scale](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Scale.html)
the top part a wee smaller and "spiral" (not really, only curl up) all the
points for top / base parts of the geometry.

The rest is plotting points from the known values (in
`xy_plot_pts`, `xz_plot_pts`, `yz_plot_pts`) to other axis values so for example
the nodes of the geometry in the `xz` plot are set up as

```
st_point(
    -1.0 * (st_x(node.geom)),
    st_z(node.geom)
)
```
and the `yz` plot nodes as

```
st_point(
    st_y(node.geom),
    st_z(node.geom)
)
```

**Note** the use of `-1.0` in `xy` and `xz` plots - this rotates the coordinates
for the axis around.

And then finally `helper_lines` constructs a set of _helper lines_ that would be
useful for transferring measurement (!) values from one view to the other.
These lines are always perpendicular to the axis of the drawing.
