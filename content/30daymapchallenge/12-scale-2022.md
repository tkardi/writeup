description: "#30DayMapChallenge: Comparing geometry simplification functions on a set on linestrings in PostGIS."
---
Let's run another comparison of PostGIS functions. This time simplification
which is a an integral part of preparing data for maps on multiple
scales.

We'll look at:

- [st_reduceprecision](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_ReducePrecision.html)
- [st_simplifypreservetopology](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_SimplifyPreserveTopology.html)
- [st_simplify](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Simplify.html)
- [st_simplifyvw](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_SimplifyVW.html)

For the data we'll use a linestring in a shape of "S", and `generate_series` a
few copies of them into boxes of equal width and height: 400 m * 400 m.
Along the `y`- axis of the plot we'll have different simplification functions
battling out, and along `x` different levels of tolerance.

To ease the understanding of what's going on, every box has two numbers in the
lower right corner. The first one (upper) is the number of nodes that are left
to the geometry after simplification with the function. The lower one shows
the average length of segments (derived with
[st_dumpsegements](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_DumpSegments.html)) from the
simplification.

Thing to note here is that (as the name says)
[st_reduceprecision](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_ReducePrecision.html) works a
bit differently than the rest - its main job is to reduce the precision of
coordinates, much like [st_snaptogrid](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_SnapToGrid.html)
only that it will not return invalid geometries and will remove those completely
that are below the tolerance.
