### Data
- [Estonian Land Board 1m DEM](https://geoportaal.maaamet.ee/eng/Maps-and-Data/Elevation-data/Download-Elevation-Data-p664.html)

### Tools
Blender

### Summary
So. Blender. THERE'S SO MANY CHOICES. A very steep learning curve. But luckily
there are some old Tool records. So for example if you can find the 10000 days
album then you can view this map of Tartu in 3D.
