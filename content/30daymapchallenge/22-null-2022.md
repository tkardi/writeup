Null (as in database `null`) is a funny value - it can come in any type

```
select
    pg_typeof(null::geometry),
    pg_typeof(null::boolean),
    pg_typeof(null::int),
    pg_typeof(null::varchar),
    pg_typeof(null::bytea),
    pg_typeof(null::int[])
;
```

![Null can be cast to literally any type in the database](../img/d22-2022/casting-null.png)

In todays SQL lets look at what null is and null is not. The answers
will be divided into three hexagons constructed with
[st_hexagon](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Hexagon.html):

- the `unknown` - where the output of the logical operation is `null`
- and the `boolean` - where the output of the logical operation can be either
`true` or `false`

the null-tests are organized as a single row in the CTE `d` and then transposed
using PostgreSQL
[row_to_json](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-CREATION-TABLE) and
[json_each_text](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-PROCESSING-TABLE)
functions to rows of keys and values.
