description: "#30DayMapChallenge: WGS84 longitude coordinate precision relationship to ground distance in meters - the effect of latitude."
---
Back almost 15-20 years ago when I started working in GIS I remember an older
colleague telling me that when choosing coordinate precision in degrees for
the area at the latitudes of Estonia the rule of thumb is approximately:

- 1° for 100 km
- 0.1° for 10 km
- 0.01° for 1 km / 1000 m
- 0.001° for 100 m
- 0.0001° for 10 m
- 0.00001° for 1 m
- 0.000001° for 0.1 m / 10 cm
- 0.0000001° for 1 cm
- and so on

Not exact figures, but more or less.

This is exactly what came to my mind when some time ago the xkcd
coordinate precision comic was making its rounds

{{< tweet 1145781178907033600 >}}

The funny (at least to me in my mind) thing with a reference system in degrees
on a sphere is that the further away you move from the equator towards any of the
poles the less precision you would need for your data not to be packed into a
"grid". So for example (but depending on what you're trying to do - see
the xkcd comic above) on the equator it makes a difference if you use 4 decimal
places or 5 decimal places for coordinates in degrees. But if you're exactly at
the pole it makes no difference whatsoever - when the latitude is 90° (or -90°)
it doesn't really matter if the precision is zero, one, five, or whatever decimal
places. Even more - the meridian value will not have any impact at all. You'll
be -180° .. 180° west and east all the time and at the same time.

Today's entry to the challenge depicts the relationship between
ground distance unit (meter) and the longitude coordinate decimal degree
precision as we move from the equator towards any of the poles. Latitude lines of
20 of the worlds biggest cities (according to Wikipedias
[List of largest cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_cities)
with their locations from [NaturalEarth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/))
are also shown. And in addition [Longyearbyen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longyearbyen)
and [Ushuaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ushuaia) as a reference. These
will serve as the y-axis grid.

The _isoprecision_ lines themselves are calculated in the CTE `pts` by creating
a line from the Null Island to the North pole along the Greenwich meridian
with [st_makeline](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_MakeLine.html)
and adding vertices to it every 0.1 degrees with
[st_segmentize](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Segmentize.html) and dumping
all vertices with [st_dumppoints](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_DumpPoints.html).
These will serve as the "original points".

Next [st_translate](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Translate.html) all the points
by delta longitude from a series of precisions in `translates`.
And then create the _isoprecision_ line by creating new nodes at
the "original point" [st_y](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Y.html)
but setting the x-coordinate at the value of
[st_distancespheroid](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Distance_Spheroid.html)
between the "original point" and the corresponding translated point. Finally
aggregate these together into a linestring over the used precision value and
in the order of original points.
