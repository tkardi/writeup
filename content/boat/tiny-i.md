Long story short. I did not find time to work on the new boat last summer and
neither this year. And next year might be under question aswell. So to keep
myself busy and learn some finer details on boatbuilding, and maybe, if lucky,
end up even doing some sailing, I started a side project of building _Tiny_,
a 6ft dinghy/sailboat from a 1950 edition of
[**the Popular Mechanics**](https://archive.org/details/PopularMechanics23Boats/mode/2up?view=theater).

Having lived my life in a world of non-imperial system of lengths I soon discovered
that the sizes really are very **tiny**. For example the width of transom, 27
inches does not make me even blink an eye, do a conversion to metric - ohhh, that's
a bit less than 70 cm... Which made think that I can actually take the original
measurements and scale everything by 1.33 so I would end up with an 8ft boat
instead. And 8ft (2.40 m) would be perfect as the local legislation requires
everything bigger than LOA 2.50 m to be registered in the vehicle registry.

_Tiny_ is going to be in the approximate size class of
[**Optimist**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimist_(dinghy)): "_[..] a small
single-handed sailing dinghy for use by young people up to the age of 15_".
Although the Wikipedia page in estonian is more forgiving to older people
stating that it is also suitable for beginners.

## Lofting, strongback

Since the plans themselves are pretty much a typical backyard build, I figured
it would make sense to loft the boat before build fullsize, so it would be easier to
take arbitrary measurements and check angles. Also, to get the general feel
of the curves. I did the lofting in original size but converted to metric with
rounding to about a half-a-centimeter precision.

After doing the profile, half-breadth, and body-plan and included a few
corrections, I dug out the dog shed material (dismanteled earlier in the
summer) to build the only frame according to the rescaled sizes. I remember
having troubles with marking up a centerline during my first boat-build (which
absolutely coincidentally started almost exactly 10 years ago, mid-August 2013)
which ended in the starboard side being a few cm wider than port side. So I decided
to play it safe this time and mark it correctly and usably.

For the frame top and bottom pieces I measured their respective centers and drew
a line circumnavigating the whole piece making sure both ends of the scribed
line meet. Then took a scrap piece of lumber and drew a straight line long
enough (frame height plus a litte more). After that it was just the matter of
getting the frame top and bottom pieces to line up with the helper line.

![Constructing a support frame, aligning on centerline](../img/tiny/frame.jpg)

The original plans call for two large pieces of 30 cm wide planks
(which would be 40cm after rescaling) for planking the sides of the hull. It
would have taken some time and effort to find these. And since I was not going
to use plywood (although the thought did cross my mind, but this build is
not about getting a boat, it's about me learning working methods) I saw a chance
to try out [**carvel planking**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carvel_(boat_building))
where the side planks are laid out edge-to-edge. Especially as _the big boat_
should be carvel planked aswell.

In turn this meant I would not be dealing with a few pieces to fit together
anymore and in order to get the measurements straight I decided to construct
a kind of a [**strongback**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongback_(girder))
on which to fix the transom, frame, and stem while I do the planking. As I
found only two long enough pieces of 5*10cm lumber at home and some shorter
ones decided to build it a triangle shape.

## Stem and transom

For the stem I found a leftover piece of siberian larch from the frame
build for _the big boat_ from two years ago. Hand-planed it roughly to
dimensions and fitted loosely on the strongback.

![Fitting the stem piece to strongback](../img/tiny/strongback-and-stem.jpg)

Since by this time I was still not sure how this build will end, I did not feel
like making any extra expenditures on lumber so the transom was constructed by
laminating together four pieces of 2.2*10 cm pine (or spruce?) planks
(of the _ex-dog-shed brand_). After having sanded the contact surfaces (edges)
and the fore sides I soon discovered that the stock material is not really of
equal width. Since I had no access to a thickness planer I decided to do the
lamination nevertheless but leave the aft side unprocessed for the time being.
Since it's on the outside it will be easily accessible afterwards aswell.
As leveled space is hard to find and to help fix the planks to each other I
bore four aligend holes to all contact edges and attached wooden
[**dowels**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowel) there during lamination
helping to secure the planks to each other and not slip when clamping.

Made me feel so proud of myself having thought about that beforehand.
It's only the next morning that it occured to me that "well, you were supposed
to fix _cleats_ to the sides too". The pieces that the hull side planking is
going to be fixed... Only realizing a few minutes later that I was supposed to
saw out the rough shape before I could do that. So taking the aft and fore
measurements of transom from the lofting, drew the shape and rough cut to size.
As some parts of the transom will be bigger on the fore side (e.g sides), and
some on the aft side (e.g the top arc), makes sense to pay extra attention here.

Meanwhile I got the frame fixed loosely on the strongback. And it does look like
a mock of something out of the imperial starfleet.

![Fitting the frame to strongback](../img/tiny/strongback-and-frame.jpg)

Using a thin polyester string attached to the strongback as a hypothetical
centerline there was nothing else to do but to align the centers and attach  
all the pieces at correct measurements to the strongback. As easy as it sounds,
it took quite some time and I still wasn't sure that everything is correct. But
that's what dry fitting is for. For checking for any errors, omissions, or
things you might not like.

![Dry-fitting the transom to strongback](../img/tiny/all-on-strongback.jpg)

And this is exactly what happened. There was something wrong with the shape
being too banana-like. So I went back to the lofting, and after puzzling myself
for almost half a day, discovered I had taken some measurements wrongly so the transom
was supposed to go further back and the frame lower down. I finally got to fix
the transom and the frame to their possible correct positions in order to see
the chine curves for the first time in real life.

But I had to put the build on a pause, as I had to do some repairs to the house
terrace instead. But in turn this gave me time to think about how to do the
planking, and more importantly out of what to do the planking.
