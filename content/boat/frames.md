The summer has been really nice and warm - I for one have welcomed the +30 degrees
Celsius summer days nice for sitting outside or working indoors with all the
windows and back-porch door open and the heat slowly creeping into house.
Unfortunately by the start of August these temperatures were gone and there's
also rain here now. Luckily I have a shed to take cover in.

Since I finished preparing the 8th frame last night and will start with the
transom today I figured it would be a perfect time to look back at this
summer's activities.

## timber

So the material. The original plans call for [_white oak_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercus_alba)
to be used for the framework which is very North-American. Traditionally in these
parts pine, spruce, and oak have been been used in ship construction.
Oak would be very fine but securing the amount that I need would be tad too
expensive - especially considering that there's a risk of everything going totally
wrong and the whole thing ending in a gigantic bonfire - a very expensive one.
After some pondering and a few talks with far more competent
people (the local shipwrights) I decided to go instead with
[_Siberian larch_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larix_sibirica).

Finally managed to find a place where I could go and do some sorting myself.
Of course everything does not always follow plan so the dimensions I needed were
`1 3/4'' * 4''` (roughly 4.5cm * 10cm) for the keel and framework, so a
five-times-ten plus some extra labor on my part would have sufficed. But the
stock available was only 5cm*12.5cm. And to add to that - the cross sections
were almost all completely wrong... For the keel I wanted _tangential cuts_ which
was relatively easy to find, and for the frames and stem _radial cuts_ which in
turn was very hard. Not to mention some _boxed hearts_.
But as I needed to do some cutting up by myself anyway I figured I could
epoxy laminate two or more tangential cuts into a radial and ended up buying
all the stock that was available.

Some of the lumber that I picked up had some deformations at places, and some
with twists in them but as these were 5+ meters long and most of these would have to
be cut into shorter lengths anyway I didn't really mind about it. That was going
to be just another sorting and measuring thing. Anyway I'm hoping that I'll be
able to do all the main frames including the transom (framing at least) plus
the keel and stem out of these.

## starting the build

[In the end of last year](../developing-a-body-plan/) I lofted the full size
body plans on building paper and the first idea was to do full size frame plans
on paper aswell but after some longer thoughts on this I decided to do all
the frames on the shed floor instead one by one. Starting with a whatever datum
line and a centerline at a right angle to what all frames will be relative to.
Using a _tick stick_ just like before picking up measurements from the loft
drawing I'm going to be drawing up every frame one by one including the 20 cm
wide floor support and 15 cm wide chine knees. As soon as the drawing for a frame
is complete I can prepare the material and then assemble it on top of the drawing.
