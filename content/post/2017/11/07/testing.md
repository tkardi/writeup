Hello, hello, is this thing on?

This is a sandbox for checking how things look and feel like.

<a name="testinganchor">
Here's</a> a silly world map made in QGIS:
![Made with Natural Earth. Free vector and raster map data @ naturalearthdata.com.](/img/maailm_3301.png)

If I quoted something, it'd be like this:

> Nobody expects the Spanish inquisition

A code snippet will look like

```python
def something():
    return 42
```

And now for something completely different, a table:

| Col1          | Col2          | Col3          |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| one           | two           | three         |
| eight         | six           | four          |
| 7             | nine          | five          |


Here's some headers. Or go back to the [map](#testinganchor).

# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3

#### Header 4

##### Header 5

###### Header 6
